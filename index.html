      <p>Hello, world!</p>
      <p>I am Matthew Fogle.</p>
      <section>What I find interesting </section>
      <h1><b>What we did in the class</b></h1>
      <p>I have taken a web design class in highschool and I enjoyed creating a small website seeing how the URL's
      and what not have worked so it has been cool seeing how each function particularly works with each other.<br>
      We ended up making a<em>fully functional</em>game in the class which was pretty cool.<br>
    <strong>My game was a clicker game.</strong></p>
      <h2><b>What the game did</b></h2>
      <p><em>It had a few buttons and images to click onto.</em><br>
      <strong>It was my first game I had created</strong><br>
      <mark>I did have to get a lot of help to figure out how to make all of the aspects work.</mark><br>
      But I had made it to where when you click a button you would increment the amount of money you would have.<br>
      Once you got to a certain amount of money you were able to upgrade your clicking to earn more money per click.<br>
      although it was small and silly the coding aspect interested me a lot seeing the variables and way the button worked in coding just fascinated me.<br></p>
      <h3>Other things</h3>
      <p>The way video games are coded and the way they operate/function is what caused me to want to be a video game designer.<br>
      Seeing the work of how things turned out from coding and the appreciation from the community of the game is very wholesome.<br>
    <strong><em><b>I am hoping to be able to make a game that is loved by all and that could make me proud of how far I have come.</b></em></strong></p>
